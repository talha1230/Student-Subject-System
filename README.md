- Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 or higher
- Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager)
- Maven
- Visual Studio Code

## Setting Up the Project

### Backend

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourorganization/student-subject-system.git
    cd student-subject-system/backend
    ```

2. **Open the backend folder in Visual Studio Code:**
